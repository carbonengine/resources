carbon-resources CLI
====================

The CLI exposes operations to be performed on the CI to create patches and bundles.

carbon-resources operations are exposed along with the same input variables as the lib target.

Detailed help refer to the CLI documentation.

.. code::

   $ .\carbon-resources -h
   $ .\carbon-resources create-group -h
   $ .\carbon-resources create-patch -h
   $ .\carbon-resources create-bundle -h

Alternatively as the operations map directly to the carbon-resources library, the :doc:`api` documentation can be referred to for further information.


Extended CLI
------------
An extended CLI can be generated by specifying ``DEV_FEATURES`` during configure.
The extended version exposes additional functionality that would ususally be covered by the lib.
However, it may be useful for QA and test automation pipelines.
