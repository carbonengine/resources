How To Create A Patch
=====================

The resource groups generated in the previous section can now be use to generate a patch.

Note: This document refers to filesystem types, see :doc:`../DesignDocuments/filesystemDesign` for more details.

.. code::

    .\carbon-resources.exe create-patch PreviousResourceGroup.yaml NextResourceGroup.yaml --resource-source-base-path-previous C:\PreviousBuild --resource-source-base-path-next C:\NextBuild

**Arguments:**

1. Positional argument 1 - Path to previous resource group
2. Positional argument 2 - Path to next resource group
3. --resource-source-base-path-previous - base path to source resources for previous
3. --resource-source-base-path-next - base path to source resources for next

.. note::
    See CLI help for more information regarding options.

This will create a patch in the folder ``PatchOut`` which contains:

1. A PatchResourceGroup.yaml file - This holds the patch information including a list of binary patches required for the full patch.
2. The ``Patches`` directory which contains the binary patch data, by default this is saved in a ``LOCAL_CDN`` file structure which are in a CDN friendly structure but uncompressed. See :doc:`../OverviewDocuments/filesystemDesign` For more information regarding filesystem design.

.. note::
    The patch data generated by default is not compressed so is not reflective of the finished patch size.

This will create
1. A ``PatchResourceGroup.yaml`` at the default location ``PatchOut/PatchResourceGroup.yaml``.
2. Patch binaries at default location ``PatchOut/Patches`` using the default filesystem type ``LOCAL_CDN``
